# Smults or (a.k.a Steem MULti Tags Search)

[steemit.com](https://steemit.com) allows searches by using only ONE tag while [busy.org](https://busy.org/) searches by single user's name. This is inconvenient for those who need to look for more specific posts. [Smults](https://smults-search.appspot.com) allows for multiple tags search and the ability to mark first tag as category.

### TODO
1. [MUST]Explore unit testing with Jest and Enzyme
2. [UI - Enchancement]Clickable author and category links
3. [UI + FUNCTIONAL - Potential Enchancement]Results order are haphazard. Sort results by ascending or descending time.
4. [UI - Potential Enchancement]Sortable/Movable tags in search bar. Such that first tag can be changed.
5. [UI + FUNCTIONAL - Potential Enchancement]Feeling lucky - Random filter + random (not so popular tags) tags search results.
6. [UI - Potential Enchancement]It could be good if author reputation are displayed
