      searches by single user's name, this is inconvenient for those who need to look for more specific posts. Smults is here to address this issue!

      Can I add custom tags in the search bar?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sure! Just start typing and press 'Enter' to include the tag(s) when you are done!
    </p>
    <h3>
      Why '15' trending tags to start with? Why not '18' or '23'?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Well.. That's just my personal preference ;). You can add more custom search tags by youself!
    </p>
    <h3>
      What is this 'Mark first tag as category' checkbox thing?
    </h3>
    <p>
      When you mark it and search, the return results will have their categories as the first tag you are searching for. Isn't that just convenient? ;)
